<h4 class="p1">Simple answers to your most common&nbsp;questions</h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>What's included?<br></b></span>Good question! Every theme ships with an example site, compiled CSS and JavaScript, new theme-specific components, a documentation page, a Gulpfile for compiling on your own, and the source Less/Sass and JavaScript files (Less for Bootstrap 3, Sass for Bootstrap 4 – both are included in the download).&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>What devices and browsers do you support?<br></b></span>We support the latest versions of Safari (OS X and iOS), Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer. Internet Explorer 9-11 are also supported. Opera Mini and Android's native Browser are not officially supported.</p>
<p class="p1" id="bootstrap4"><span class="s1"><b>Are the themes Bootstrap 4 yet?!<br></b></span><span>Yes they are! When you download a theme there are 2 main directories, one for the latest stable version of Bootstrap 3, and one for the latest beta&nbsp;build of Bootstrap 4. We will continue to update BS4&nbsp;themes as new versions of BS4's core are released – right now it's still in beta, but we'll keep our themes up to date as it advances towards&nbsp;a final stable build.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Are theme updates free or paid for?<br></b></span>All theme updates are free for the life of a theme. We will notify you via the email when updates are available.</p>
